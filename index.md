Welcome to this **Ga Language Learning Archive**. It's a dedicated repository of educational materials for learning and preserving the Ga language.

## About This Archive

The Ga language, spoken primarily in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, is at risk of becoming endangered in the long term. This archive was created to address two critical challenges:

1. **Insufficient teaching resources** - Not enough people are actively teaching Ga
2. **Limited online materials** - Very few digital learning resources exist for the language

Our archive was created to to preserve, promote, and make accessible quality learning materials for the Ga language, ensuring it continues to thrive for future generations.
